## 🚀 Why Sovereign Infrastructure?

Every SaaS you pay for is a piece of your sovereign control you are leasing. The mission of **AltStack** is to provide the data and deployment configurations necessary to replace the "Big Tech" stack with a **Sovereign Stack** you own.

This repository serves as the **Data HQ** for [The AltStack](https://thealtstack.com). Every tool listed here is vetted for quality, activity, and self-hostability. See [CRITERIA.md](CRITERIA.md) for the full vetting standards.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Mini-Stacks)

Get up and running in under 2 minutes. These are "Development Mode" snippets. For production-hardened setups (SSL, Backups, Auth), follow the links to The AltStack Documentation.
