## What is this repo?

This is the **data layer** for [The AltStack](https://thealtstack.com) — a curated directory of open-source alternatives to popular SaaS products. Everything the website displays comes from the files in this repo:

- The full tool database (`tools.json`)
- Docker Compose deployment configs for 68+ tools
- Blog content and editorial copy
- Category descriptions and SEO metadata
- Curated "Stack" bundles (pre-built tool combos for common use cases)

If you want to add a tool, fix a description, or contribute a Docker config — this is where you do it.

## How the Data Stays Fresh

This repo is kept up-to-date by an automated pipeline (the "Sentinel Engine") that runs nightly via GitHub Actions:

1. **Discovery** — Scans GitHub trending, Hacker News, and community submissions for new tools
2. **Validation** — Checks existing entries for dead links, archived repos, and stale projects
3. **Enrichment** — Pulls latest GitHub stars, activity metrics, and metadata
4. **Docker generation** — Auto-generates Docker Compose configs for newly added tools
5. **Content** — Generates blog posts, tool reviews, and comparison pages

The pipeline opens PRs automatically so everything gets reviewed before merging.

3. Make sure it meets our [vetting criteria](CRITERIA.md)
4. Open a PR

### Add a Docker config
1. Create a new folder in `docker-deploy/` named after the tool's slug
2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` and an `install.sh`
